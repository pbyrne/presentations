<section class="slide">
  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>Knowing is better than guessing</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>What Are We Doing Already?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li class="slide">
      <p>New Relic</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance metrics</li>
        <li>Throughput, traffic metrics</li>
        <li>Error logging</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="slide">
      <p>Custom logging</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arbitrary information about events when they occur</li>
        <li>Mostly for lookup and review after-the-fact</li>

  <h2>Aggregated Data Over Time</h2>

  <p>Three types of data it can record</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="slide">
      <p>Incrementing/Decrementing Counts</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="slide">How many users have signed up?</li>
        <li class="slide">How many games were created?</li>
        <li class="slide">Inventory</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="slide">
      <p>Length of time to complete</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="slide">How long are a particular type of request taking?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="slide">
      <p>Number of something at a given time</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="slide">How many users are logged in at this moment?</li>
        <li class="slide">How many web servers are booted at this moment?</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="slide">Historical insight into data we otherwise have been only able to get point-in-time information previously</p>

  <h2>What is StatsD?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Open-source generic metrics collector</li>
    <li>Made by Etsy</li>
    <li>Dead simple</li>
    <li>
      <p>Built not to impact your app's performance</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is <strong>vitally important</strong>, and many for-pay metrics vendors don't seem to get this right</li>
        <li>The StatsD server can be on fire, but your app will just keep moving along</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Receives stats from your app (or shell scripts, or anything) and passes along to whichever backend you have configured</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your app doesn't need to know where the data goes or the format that the backend expects</li>
        <li>The StatsD server can be on fire, but your app will just keep moving along</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Graphite is a common backend for StatsD traffic</li>
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>What is Graphite?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Open-source project to collect and graph metrics <strong>over time</strong></li>
    <li>Very powerful, but at the cost of complexity</li>
    <li>
      <p>Accepts the stats from StatsD and saves them</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data gets compressed as it ages, which is configurable if your run your own server</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The meat of it is the query language used to produce graphs</li>
    <li>
      <p>Lots of options to get the data out</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dashboards of graphs is most common</li>
        <li>Images can be embedded in other pages</li>
        <li>JSON can be fetched to get parsed by other apps</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  <h1>Word Problems</h1>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Delayed Job Queues</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>How queued do our delayed job servers get?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p>Every minute, look at the queued jobs, and record how many jobs are at each priority level</p>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>Send Stats</h3>
    <pre><code>prioties.each do |priority, count|
  # e.g., "delayed_jobs.10", 45
  Metrics.record_number("delayed_jobs.#{priority}", count)
end</code></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>Query</h3>
    <pre><code>stats.gauges.ngin_production.delayed_jobs.*</code></pre>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Ngin Web Server Capacity</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Over time, how many of our available web server workers are in use? How close to capacity are we during peak traffic?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p>Every minute, on each server, query the <code>passenger-status</code> script, and record how many active, booted, and maximum workers are available and sum them up.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>Send Stats</h3>
    <pre><code>Metrics.record_number("passengers.#{server_id}.active", stats.active)
Metrics.record_number("passengers.#{server_id}.booted", stats.booted)
Metrics.record_number("passengers.#{server_id}.max", stats.max)
Metrics.record_number("passengers.#{server_id}.queued", stats.queued)</code></pre>

  <h2>Completed Games</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>How many games are completed every night, and which sports are they for, and what type of scoring do they use?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p>Every time a game is completed, record its sport and its scoring type.</p>
